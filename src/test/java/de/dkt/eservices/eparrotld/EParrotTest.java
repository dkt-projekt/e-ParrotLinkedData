[6] Various theories have been offered that the word viking may be derived from the name of the historical Norwegian district of Viken (or Víkin in Old Norse ), meaning “a person from Viken \". According to this theory, the word simply de- scribed persons from this area, and it is only in the last few centuries that it has taken on the broader sense of early medieval Scandinavians in general. However, there are a few major problems with this theory. People from the Viken area were not called 'Viking' in Old Norse manuscripts, butarereferredtoasvíkverir(ModernNor- wegian: vikvær), 'Vík dwellers’. In addition, that ex- planation could only explain the masculine (Old Scan- dinavian víkingr) and ignore the feminine (Old Norse víking), which is a serious problem because the mascu- line is easily derived from the feminine but hardly vice "

The word Varangian may have originated in Old Norse, but in Slavic and Greek it could refer either to Scandinavians or Franks. The most eminent Scandinavian to serve in the Varangian Guard was Harald Hardrada , who subse- quently established himself as king of Norway (1047– 66). Important trading ports during the period include Birka , Hedeby , Kaupang , Jorvik , Staraya Ladoga , Novgorod , and Kiev . There is archaeological evidence that Vikings reached "

Generally speaking, the Norwegians expanded to the north and west to places such as Ireland, Scotland, Ice- land, and Greenland; the Danes to England and France, settling in the Danelaw (northern/eastern England) and Normandy ; and the Swedes to the east, founding the Kievan Rus , the original Russia. Among the Swedish runestones mentioning expeditions overseas, almost half tell of raids and travels to western Europe. According to the Icelandic sagas, many Norwegian Vikings also went to eastern Europe. In the Viking Age, the present day na- tions of Norway, Sweden and Denmark did not exist, but were largely homogeneous and similar in culture and lan- guage, although somewhat distinct geographically. The names of Scandinavian kings are reliably known only for the later part of the Viking Age. After the end of the Viking Age the separate kingdoms gradually acquired distinct identities as nations, which went hand-in-hand with their Christianization . Thus the end of the Viking"

[38] Vikings under Leif Ericson , heir to Erik the Red , reached North America and set up short-lived settlements in present-day L'Anse aux Meadows , New- foundland, and Labrador, Canada. Viking expansion into continental Europe was limited. Their realm was bordered by powerful cultures to the south.

//+ "		  2.2.1 Motives "
//+ "		  The motives driving the Viking expansion are a topic of much debate in Nordic history. One common the- ory posits that Charlemagne “used force and terror to Christianise all pagans”, leading to baptism, conversion "
//+ "		  gans resisted and wanted revenge. [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Pro- fessor Rudolf Simek states that “it is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of"
//+ "		  Scandinavia led to serious conflict dividing Norway for "
//+ "		  Another explanation is that the Vikings exploited a mo- ment of weakness in the surrounding regions. England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposi- tion throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old trade routes could also have played a role. Trade between western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the "
//+ "		  of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with "
//+ "		  Raids in Europe, including raids and settlements from Scandinavia, were not something new and also seen long before the Vikings came. The Jutes invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from Jutland during the Age of Migrations , before the Danes settled there. The Saxons and the Angles did the same, embark- ing from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in pre- "
//+ "		  2.3 End of the Viking Age "

//+ "		  300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia un- derwent profound cultural changes. By the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the Catholic Church (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ec- clesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and"

//+ "		  silver from the East had been absent for more than a cen- tury, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in "
//+ "		  Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was begin- ning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Swe- den. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at Lund , Scania, then part of Denmark. The assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th cen- tury. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly. The kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandi- navian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, Sigurd I of Norway sailed for the eastern Mediter- raneanwithNorwegiancrusaderstofightforthenewlyes- tablished Kingdom of Jerusalem , and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the Baltic Crusades of the "

//+ "		  native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordi- nary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the Icelandic sagas . A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is of course doubtful, but many specific elements re- main worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of skaldic poetry attributed to court poets of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings. Indirectly the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what spe- cific places meant to them, as seen in place names like Egilsay (from Eigils Ø meaning Eigil’s Island), Ormskirk (from Ormr kirkja meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), Meols (from merl meaning Sand Dunes), Snaefell (Snow Fell), Ravenscar (Ravens Rock), Vinland (Land of Wine or Land of Winberry ), Kaupanger (Mar- ket Harbour) and Tórshavn (Thor’s Harbour) or the re- ligious centre of Odense , meaning a place where Odin was worshipped. It is also evident in concepts like the present day Tynwald on the Isle of Man . Common words in everyday English language, like some of the week- days ( Thursday means Thor’s day), axle , crook , raft , knife , plough , leather , bylaw , thorp , skerry , ombudsman , husband , heathen , Hell , Norman and ransack stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings, and give us an opportu- nity to understand their interactions with the people and"

One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sourcesonScandinaviaintheVikingAgecomefromIce- land, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists. As a result, there is much more material from the Viking Age concerning Norway than Sweden, which apart from many runic inscriptions, has almost no written sources from the early Middle Ages. "

//+ "		  3.3 Ships "
//+ "		  Main article: Viking ships "
//+ "		  There have been several archaeological finds of Viking ships of all sizes, providing knowledge of the craftsman- ship that went into building them. There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best- "
//+ "		  intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the Leidang , the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to go Viking , which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the "
//+ "		  The reconstructed longship Sea Stallion. "
//+ "		  A model of the knarr ship type. The longship facilitated far-reaching expeditions, but the Vikings also constructed several other types of ships. "
//+ "		  The Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar sit- uations). One Viking innovation was the ' beitass ', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effec- "
//+ "		  Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore. Ships were an integral part of the Viking culture. They"
//+ "		  facilitated everyday transportation across seas and wa- terways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a ma- jor religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the "
//+ "		  the excavated ship burial at Ladby in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evi- denced by the excavations of the Salme ships on the Es- "
//+ "		  Well-preserved remains of five Viking ships were exca- vated from Roskilde Fjord in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the knarr. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century, to block a navigation channel and thus protect Roskilde , then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on dis- play at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde . "

The thralls or servants took care of most of the daily chores, while the Jarls engaged in administration, politics, hunting, sports, paid visits to other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions.

A félag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as drenge ; one of the words for warrior. There were also official commu- nities within towns and villages, the overall defence, reli- gion, the legal system and the Things .

//+ "		  Thralls were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and economy. Thralls were used as servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls and they were used for constructing fortresses, fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were suppliedbyeitherthesonsanddaughtersofthrallsorthey were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, enslaved and made them into thralls. The new thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on lo- cation or in newer settlements to build needed structures or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'træl' and 'ty'. Karls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milkingthecattle, buildinghousesandwagons, but employed thralls to make ends meet.

In areas with mountains, mountain climbing was prac- tised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested byrunning andjumping forsport, andthere ismention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the out- side of a ship’s railing as it was being rowed. Swimming was a popular sport and Snorri Sturluson describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Chil- dren often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, al- though it is unclear if they took part in competition. King OlafTryggvason washailedasamasterofbothmountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of knife juggling as well. Skiing and ice skating were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter time and in the colder re- gions of the north. Horse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pit- ted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced- off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often re- sulted in the death of one of the stallions. Icelandic sources refer to the sport of knattleik . A ball game akin to hockey , knattleik involved a bat and a small"

Hunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it wasnotregardedasanimportantoccupation. Birds, deer , hares and foxes werehuntedwithbowandspear,andlater with crossbows.

Ac- cording to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them all the time. These arms were indicative of a Viking’s social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet , shield , mail shirt, and sword. A typical bóndi (freeman)wasmorelikelytofightwitha spear andshield, and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side- arm.

Early transmission of this informa- tion was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, in- cluding the Icelanders Snorri Sturluson and Sæmundur fróði . Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes. The 200-year Viking influence on European history is filled with tales of plunder and colonization, and the ma- jority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants.

The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen’s Edda Islandorum of 1665). InScandinavia,the17th-centuryDanishscholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and the Swede Olaus Rudbeck used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was George Hicke, who published his Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus in 1703– 05. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusi- asm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dra- matically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues. The word “viking” was first popularised at the begin- ning of the 19th century by Erik Gustaf Geijer in his poem, The Viking . Geijer’s poem did much to prop- agate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of Romanticism in the Old North had contemporary polit- ical implications. The Geatish Society , of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent.

Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain’s Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Ger- many, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Den- mark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandina- vian mythology by Richard Wagner . The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with "

The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nation- alism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed in- terpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of Nazi mysticism . Other political organizations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling , similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda. In communist Russia, the ideology of Slavic racial purity led to the complete denial that Scandinavians had played a part in the emergence of the principalities of the Rus’, which were supposed to have been founded by Slavs. Ev- idence to the contrary was suppressed until the 1990s.

//+ "		  Since the 1960s, there has been rising enthusiasm for historical reenactment . While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include The Vikings and Regia Anglorum , though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups par- ticipate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats. The Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of Minnesota .

//+ "		  The Vikings were often depicted with winged helmets and in other clothing taken from Classical antiquity , es- pecially in depictions of Norse gods. This was done to legitimize the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealized in European culture. The latter-day mythos created by national romantic ideas blended the Viking Age with aspects of the Nordic Bronze Age some 2,000 years earlier. Horned hel- mets from the Bronze Age were shown in petroglyphs and appeared in archaeological finds (see Bohuslän and Vikso helmets). They were probably used for ceremonial "

The for- mal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard “ship islands”) would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the war- rior’s own side. Historians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking war- riors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the "
